\section{Introduction}
The substantial decade-long reduction in global malaria burden stalled in 2016 with an estimated increase of 5 million cases.

Mathematical models is a vital way to help public health practitioners to policy decisions. Thus, it is crucial to know how they are made and the assumptions on which they are built. Mathematical models has been introduced into malaria control world for many years. History could go back to 1920s, when Ronald Ross introduced the first version of malaria model.

However, differences in model structures and data been used in model calibration results in no consensus yet exists on the optimal version or output of the model. Conflicts in the different model predictions arising from the data sets used in their calibration and the behind mechanism. 

That's why this document was created to facilitate the understanding the 

\section{Mathematical Methods}

Two types of models are commonly used in the epidemiology world: the deterministic version and stochastic version.

\subsection{Deterministic Model}

Commonly used in describing disease. 

\improvement{add definition}

\subsubsection{SIR Model}

\subsubsection{SEIR Model}

\subsubsection{Other Variation}

\subsection{Stochastic Model}

Stochastic means has a random value. The stochastic version of 

Also known as epidemiological \gls{abm}, stochastic model is a special use case of a broader class of \gls{abm}. \gls{abm} is a class of computational models to simulate actions and interactions between "agents". The first version of \gls{abm} can be track back to 1971\cite{Schelling1971}. More recently \gls{abm} have been used to inform public health interventions against flu\cite{Ferguson2006a, Ferguson2005} and COVID-19\cite{Maziarz2020, Ferguson2020, Chang2020}

Individual based, simulated version of model, require multiple run to simulate.

The vatange of agent-based models come at the price of the much higher computational resources.

\section{Model Assumptions}
Models are only as good as they made reasonable assumptions. In malaria mathematical modelling world, several assumptions have been made. The most important ones ranked as follows,

1. Homogeneous mixing of population: in the deterministic types of model, individuals in the same state groups are considered as the same, e.g. Susceptible group has an average probability of transit to infectious group. But the assumption is rarely justified.



\section{Entomology}

The gonotrophic cycle of a female mosquito begins with a blood meal taken from a host. The mosquito will rest and wait for digestion. It may take several blood meals before searching for a breeding site for oviposition. After egg maturation, the mosquito tries to find a suitable site and then lay 80 - 100 eggs.

\subsection{Adult Mosquitoes}

\subsubsection{Endophily}
Research papers often take endophily as a fixed parameter in the model, which means for each different vector there is one according level of endophily.

And the model used in the research often use a

  \improvement{TODO: added an example figure of logistic growth}
	
	Does the birth rate of vectors follow the same line?

\subsection{Larval}

Larvea feeds on yeasts, bacteria and organic matters. After four moults, larvea become pupae, and then develop into adult mosquitoes.

\section{Interventions}

Two core interventions defined by WHO: \gls{llins}, \gls{irs}

Effects of \gls{llins} and \gls{irs}:

\begin{itemize}
\item Deferred from entering, measured by by the number of mosquitoes caught in a hut with an intervention compared to a control hut
\item enter the hut and either exit without feeding
\item Die
\item Successfully blood-fed
\item Lower down the survival rates for adults mosquitoes in \gls{eip} 
\item less eggs being oviposited in breeding sites
\end{itemize}

Effects of \gls{irs} \cite{Sherrard-Smith2018b}:

\gls{irs} product effectiveness varies depending on factors including: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item impact on mosquito populations (for example, an ability to kill or deter mosquitoes from entering a sprayed structure); 
  \item impact duration (the residual half-life); 
  \item where and when sprays are deployed (local malaria endemicity, seasonality of transmission and timing of IRS, mosquito species, human behaviour and net-use), and; 
  \item spray quality and coverage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{effectiveness}

Prevalence results from Uganda \gls{rct}\cite{Staedke2020}:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
  Type & 6 months & 12 months & 18 months\\ 
  \gls{llins} & 15 & 13 & 14 \\  
  \gls{pbo} & 11 & 11 & 12\\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{attrition}
From Tanzania\cite{Protopopoff2018} \gls{rct}, the permethrin and \gls{pbo} concentration dropped at a steady rate for both standard \gls{llins} and Pyrethroid-PBO \gls{llins}:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
  chemical & 0 months & 12 months & 21 months\\ 
  Permethrin(Regular) & 21.4 & 21.5 & 16.7\\  
  Permethrin(PBO) & 20.9 & 14.7 & 12.2\\
  PBO & 9.5 & 2.9 & 1.6
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

From Uganda\cite{Staedke2020}, the \gls{pbo} dropped:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
  chemical & 0 months & 12 months\\ 
  \gls{pbo}PermaNet 3.0 & 26.18 & 15.28\\  
  \gls{pbo}Olyset Plus & 8.17 & 5.04\\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Usage attrition from Tanzania\cite{Protopopoff2018}:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c }
  index & 4 months & 21 months\\ 
  ownership & 97.6 & - \\  
  access & 89.6 & 70.2\\
  usage & 76.9 & 50.6
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
  \gls{irs} & 0 months & 9 months & 12 months\\ 
  Actellic 300CS & 0.99 & 0.82 & 0.59  \\  
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Usage attrition from Uganda\cite{Staedke2020} showed a much slower trend in the decease in usage:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ c c c c }
  index & 6 months & 12 months & 18 months\\ 
  ownership & 97 & 95 & 91 \\  
  adequate coverage & 71 & 63 & 51\\
  usage & 85 & 79 & 73
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Costs}
Cost of Interventions increases when coverage increase. \cite{Winskill2017a} considered two approaches to simulate the function:
\begin{itemize}
	\item linear increases in cost associated with increasing coverage
	\item delivery cost increases logarithmically with increasing coverage
\end{itemize}

Total cost was assumed to consist of two components: the commodity and the delivery. The commodity part of cost follows U-shape curves follows the marginal cost formula.

$$ MC = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Q} $$

In the short run, marginal cost ($MC$) drops when quantity($Q$) increases, then increase as $Q$ increases.

The delivery part increase as coverage increase. For the linear assumption, J

\subsubsection{Costs of IRS}
range from USDA 2–3 to roughly USDA 20 per unit\cite{Oxborough2016}
(a unit is stander- diced across products to cover approximately 250 of wall surface)

\section{Diseases}
States:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Susceptible
	\item Treating
	\item Disease(with symptom)
	\item Patently Asymptomatic

\end{itemize}

\section{immunity}

\section{Resistance}

Strong association between the level of resistance and mosquito mortality observed in the experimental hut trial\cite{Sherrard-Smith2018b}.

\unsure{to understand how they made the connection: did the researcher match the bioassay result to the experimental hut trial data? Find conclusions and methods in the paper and summarized it in this document.}

\unsure{how does mosquito resistance affect the repel rate? Why do the mosquitoes don't like the pyrethroid  smell? And why does the mosquitoes' repel rate drops down when the resistance level goes up?}

Resistance level in discriminating bioassay: the percentage of mosquitoes surviving 24-hours following exposure.

The impact of reduced susceptibility of mosquito:
\begin{itemize}
  \item the initial efficacy is reduced
  \item the active life-length of the insecticide is shorter as fewer mosquitoes are susceptible
\end{itemize}

\change{add the mathematical equation that describe the decrease.}

One comment on the second point is that it seems there are some certain level of threshold for the resistance level and active ingredient. When combining these two factors, we might able to calculate the overall efficacy of the effective length. 

\subsection{Measurement of Resistance}

Bioassay:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Discriminating Bioassay
  \item Intensity Bioassay
  \item Mechanism Bioassay
  \item Non-standard Bioassays
\end{itemize}

\section{Environment}
\section{Parameters}

Average eggs lay by female \textit{Anopheles}: 80 - 100 eggs.

Duration of the larval period depends on temperature, in tropical areas, lasts 7 - 15 days.\cite{bayoh_lindsay_2003}
